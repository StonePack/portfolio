# Portfolio Website
This is a portfolio website written in Flutter by Stone Pack. I'm not a designer so it doesn't look amazing. However, it displays clean code and an understanding of statefull and stateless widgets, bloc pattern, and API server interactions.

You can see it in action at stonepack.github.io. If you like what you see, feel free to reach out to me on my LinkedIn! Also if you want to use this for your own portfolio website feel free!
